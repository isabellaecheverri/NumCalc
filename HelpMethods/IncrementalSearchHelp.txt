Incremental Search Help

This method is used for finding the roots of any continuous function over an interval. It uses an equation of the form f(x) = 0, and iterative calculations in order to solve for the root x.

Remember to take into account the following recommendations to guarantee the operation of the numerical method.

- The function f(x) must be continuous for all real numbers.

- The interval increment dx must be strictly greater than zero. Also if a fairly small number is selected as the delta it might have consequences in terms of runtime.

- The initial value must exist in the function.

- The tolerance must have a positive value.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
