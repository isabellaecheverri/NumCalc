This method is used for finding the roots of any continuous function over an interval. It uses an equation of the form f(x) = 0, and iterative calculations to solve for x.

Remember to take into account the following recommendations to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.


- Both values, a and b must exist in the domain of the function.

- The function f must be continuous in the closed interval [a,b].

- It must follow that a < b.

- For the method to converge, it must be true that f(a) * f(b) < 0, so that there is a change of sign and therefore a root in [a,b].

- If possible, check graphically that there is an unique root in [a,b], if there are multiple roots it may damage the runtime considerably.

- Tolerance must have a positive value.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
