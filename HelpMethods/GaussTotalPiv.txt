Gaussian Total Pivoting Elimination Help
 
For solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn. The difference of this method with respect to regular Gaussian elimination is that it modifies the position of the rows and cols in order to prevent division by zero.

We encourage you to try following this guidelines in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The determinant of the matrix A cannot be zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.

- This is an alternative to the the basic method, and it provides average precision (consequence of the great amount of operations required, and error propagation), and speed (thanks to the algorithm complexity). For better results by this means, try all other methods in this section.
