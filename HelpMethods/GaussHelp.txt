Gaussian Elimination Help

For solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn.

We encourage you to try following this guidelines in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The determinant of the matrix A cannot be zero.

- The matrix A must be free of zeros in its principal diagonal, since it is not possible to divide by zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.

- Try not to input any near zero number in the main diagonal of the matriz, it causes near zero division, and it may hurt the convergence, precision and velocity of the method. If this is the case, try a Pivoting Gauss method instead.

- This is the basic method, and it provides average precision (consequence of the great amount of operations required, and error propagation), and speed (thanks to the algorithm complexity). For better results by this means, try all other methods in this section.
