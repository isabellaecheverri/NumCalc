LU Factorization Help
 
For solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn. 

The idea behind LU factorization is to factorize the matriz A into a lower triangular L, and an upper triangular matrix U, to then progressively and regressively substitute.

We encourage you to try following this advices in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The determinant of the matrix A cannot be zero.

- The main diagonal of the matrix A must not include any zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.
