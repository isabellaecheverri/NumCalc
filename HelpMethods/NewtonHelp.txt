Newton's method Help

Remember to follow the recommendations ahead to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.

This method is used for finding the roots of any continuous function over an interval. This is a widely used Fixed Point variant, and it relies on an equation of the form f(x) = 0, transformed into an g(x) = x expression, with iterative calculations over its derivatives in order to solve for x.

- Be sure that the function f has a root.

- Also, the initial approximation is crucial. Hence it is vital graphing the function first so a point near to the root can be input.

- You need to make sure that the function f is differentiable, and preferably fully continuous. An analytic derivative makes computations significantly simpler. 

- The tolerance must have a positive value.

- Newton's method is generally faster than its counterpart methods. If the derivative approaches zero, the method loses its speed because is possible to be a case of multiple root.

- Try to visualize graphically if the derivative of f at the root is also zero. If this is the case, the method will not converge. 

- In general, do not divide by zero.
