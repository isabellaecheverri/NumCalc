Multiple Roots Help

Remember to follow the guidelines below guarantees the good behavior of the numerical method.

This method is used for finding the roots of any continuous function over an interval. It uses an equation of the form f(x) = 0, and iterative computations in order to solve for x.

- Use this method is used when various roots are cramped up together, or when they have a greater than one algebraic multiplicity. Otherwise, it will be overall slower tan most of the methods in this section.

- Ensure that the function f is continuous and differentiable two times.

- Input an initial point near the root (confirm graphically).

- Make sure you input the derivatives of f correctly.

- The tolerance must have a positive value.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
