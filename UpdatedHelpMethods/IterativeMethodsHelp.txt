Help for Iterative Methods

These methods are used for solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn. This is an iterative method, so you may introduce a tolerance value for the absolute error.

The suggestions left below, allow the code to execute optimally, taking into account the mathematical constrains of the problem. Also, these apply for all three methods.

- The matrix A must be invertible, then it must have a non zero determinant.

- The main diagonal of the matrix A must not include any zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.

- The method will only converge if the spectral radius of the transition matrix p(T) is strictly less than one.

- Also, if the matriz A is strictly diagonally dominant, the method will converge to the unique solution of the system.

- The initial vector x0 us not really important. If you followed the previous advices, the method will converge to the unique solution vector x.

- The tolerance value must be greater than zero. 

For the SOR (relaxation) method.

The relaxation methods improve the convergence of the Gauss Seidel method by refining the approximation at each stage.

- For the new parameter w, if w = 1, the pure Gauss-Seidel method will be executing.

- If w is such that 0 < w < 1, and under-relaxation method will be executed. This method is used for achieving convergence in some non convergent systems by Gauss-Seidel method.

- If w is such that 1 < w < 2, an over-relaxation method will be executed. This method speeds up convergence for slow systems using the Gauss-Seidel method.

- If the matrix A is symmetric and positively defined, the relaxation SOR method is convergent for any w between zero and two.
