Euler's method help

This method is used for numerical solving first order differential equations of the form dy/dt = f(t,y), y(t0) = y0. It assumes continuity and that the desired function exists.

Remember follow the recommendations below to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.

- The function f must be continuous and smooth.

- Input the boundary condition (t0, y0).

- The number of steps n, and step size h must be strictly positive.  

- In general, do not divide by zero.
