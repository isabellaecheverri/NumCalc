Doolittle Factorization Help

For solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn. 

The following 
suggestions, allow the code to execute optimally, taking into account the mathematical constrains of the problem. 

- The determinant of the matrix A cannot be zero.

- The main diagonal of the matrix A must not include any zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.
