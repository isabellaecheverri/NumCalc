Trisection method help

The trisection method is a modification of the classical Bisection method. The method of bisection, which can divide an interval in two sections, leads to slow convergence. This new scheme divide the interval into three different sections for a faster convergence. Naturally is used for solving nonlinear equations of the form f(x) = 0.

- Both values, a and b must exist in the domain of the function.

- The function f must be continuous in the closed interval [a,b].

- The program considers a function y = f(x), then input a function with just x as its independent variable.

- It must follow that a < b.

- For the method to converge, it must be true that f(a) * f(b) < 0, so that there is a change of sign and therefore a root in [a,b].

- If possible, check graphically that there is an unique root in [a,b], if there are multiple roots it may damage the runtime considerably.

- Tolerance must have a positive value.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
