Muller's Help

Muller's method is a root-finding algorithm, a numerical method for solving equations of the form f(x) = 0.

We encourage you to try following this guidelines in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The function f must be continuous over the real line.

- The function takes three initial values, x0, x1, x2, and its recommended that all of them are close to the real root X. Try checking graphically first.

- The tolerance value must be positive, and preferably close to zero.
