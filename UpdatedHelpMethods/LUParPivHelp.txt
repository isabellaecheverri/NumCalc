LU Partial Pivoting Help

For solving linear equation systems of the form Ax = b, where A is an n x n matrix, b is the solution vector of dimension n x 1, and x is the unknown vector x1, x2, ..., xn. 

This is the same idea as LU factorization, but with the versatility that comes with pivoting. Also this is relatively more precise than its predecessor.

We encourage you to try following this advices in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The determinant of the matrix A cannot be zero.

- The main diagonal of the matrix A must not include any zero.

- The matrix A must be square and must have the same number of rows than the vector b.
