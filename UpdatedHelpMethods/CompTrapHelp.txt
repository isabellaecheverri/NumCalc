Composite Trapezoidal Help

This method is used for numerical integration over the closed interval [a,b].

Remember to take into account the following recommendations to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.


- The boundary conditions must satisfy that a < b.

- The function f must be continuous in the closed interval [a,b]. Even if the discontinuities are integrable, the method does not consider them, and it might increase the error significantly.

- Input a function f with x as its only independent variable.

- The number of divisions n must be strictly positive.

- If a negative value is returned, the average area under the curve is located under the x axis.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
