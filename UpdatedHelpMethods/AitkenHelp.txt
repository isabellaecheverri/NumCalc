Aitken's Help

Aitken's process or Aitken extrapolation is a series acceleration method, used for accelerating the rate of convergence of a sequence. This method is a root-finding algorithm, a numerical method for solving equations of the form f(x) = 0.

We encourage you to try following this advices in order to prevent any exception, error or mistake from the method.

- The function f, and the function g must be continuous over the real line.

- Both functions must be only written in terms of the independent variable x.

- Try locating graphically the real root X, then have x0 to be near that root.

- The tolerance value must be positive, and preferably close to zero.

- In general do not divide by any number around the order 10^-16.
