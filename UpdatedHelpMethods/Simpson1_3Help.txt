Simpson 1/3 Help

This method is used for numerical integration over the closed interval [a,b]. It uses a truncated Taylor series based on a 2nd order polynomial, and is more precise than the Trapezoid method. It requires an even number of subdivisions n.

Remember follow the recommendations below to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.

- The boundary conditions must satisfy that a < b.

- The function f must be continuous in the closed interval [a,b]. Even if the discontinuities are integrable, the method does not consider them, and it might increase the error significantly.

- Input a function f with x as its only independent variable.

- The number of divisions n must be strictly positive, and even. 

- If a negative value is returned, the average area under the curve is located under the x axis.

- In general, do not divide by zero.
