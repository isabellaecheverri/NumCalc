Spline Help

Spline methods are used for solving a continuous model problem. Given a set of points {(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)}, there exists an unknown function f, that will be approximated via a polynomial of degree n. 

Spline methods interpolate the function by considering independent sections of the plane within the points (xi, yi) and (xi+1, yi+1) modeled as polynomials of the desired degree. This method preserves smoothness over the derivative of the inferior degree derivatives. Also, this method is easier to compute and its overall pretty precise.

Remember to take into account the following recommendations to guarantee the well behavior of the numerical method.

- All values of x and y must be different. If there are equal values of x among different points, you are not interpolating a function. If there are equal values of y, the method may not converge to a function that represents the behavior of the distribution.

- Try obtaining the (xi, yi) in the most precise way, since these points remain unchanged, and the rest of the interpolation relies on them.
